# TestAgentDemo – Agentic QA Workflow Demo (Cursor + Playwright)

This repository demonstrates **Agentic QA Workflow** using:

- Playwright Test  
- Playwright AI Agents (Planner, Generator, Healer)  
- Cursor AI Orchestration  

The workflow performs:

> PLAN → DEVELOP → TEST → HEAL → REPORT

for two demo targets:

- UI E2E: https://www.saucedemo.com/
- API: https://petstore.swagger.io/

---

## Playwright Agent Files (Original, DO NOT MODIFY)

Generated by:

npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode


Files:

- `.github/chatmodes/planner.chatmode.md`
- `.github/chatmodes/generator.chatmode.md`
- `.github/chatmodes/healer.chatmode.md`
- `.vscode/mcp.json`

Cursor orchestrator rule uses these as authoritative definitions.

### Updating Playwright Agents

To update the Playwright agent files in the future, run:

```bash
npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode
```

This will regenerate the agent files:
- `.github/chatmodes/planner.chatmode.md`
- `.github/chatmodes/generator.chatmode.md`
- `.github/chatmodes/healer.chatmode.md`
- `.vscode/mcp.json`

**Note:** After updating, review any changes to ensure compatibility with the Cursor orchestrator rules in `.cursor/rules/testagent.mdc`.

## How to Use in Cursor

Inside Cursor, run commands such as:

- **"Run the TestAgentDemo loop for saucedemo"**  
- **"Plan → Generate → Test → Heal → Report petstore API"**  

The TestAgentDemo orchestrator will then:

1. PLAN → Create test plan in `tests/plans/*.md`
2. DEVELOP → Generate Playwright tests into `tests/e2e/` or `tests/api/`
3. TEST → Ask to run `npx playwright test`
4. HEAL → Suggest minimal fixes based on failures
5. REPORT → Produce a Markdown test report in `reports/*.md`

---

## Running Tests Manually

```bash
npm install
npx playwright test
